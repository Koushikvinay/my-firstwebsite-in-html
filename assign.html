    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, 
        the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. 
        Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, 
        covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. 
        The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, 
        most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within one hemisphere, 
        Earth's land hemisphere</p>
